# React-Flash-Cards
Interactive study aid, web based flashcard application used to test your knowledge on a given subject.
User is able to add, delete, and edit both decks and cards for each given deck.
Study buddy application built using VS Code, React.js library, React Router and React Hooks for routing and API, HTML, JS, and Bootstrap programming lanuages, tested locally with Node.js.
This project was great practice for using React Hooks, it helped me establish a deeper understanding of the API process in React.js.
Future potential for expanding the project to include a timer to add some pressure to the flashcard study process.
