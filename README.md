# Flash-O-Matic: A digital flashcard application

## Overview
Flash-O-Matic is an application for creating, editing, and deleting digital flashcards and decks of flashcards. Each flashcard has a front and back; the front shows the question, the back shows the answer, and there is a button to flip the card. You can save a series of cards as a deck. This is useful to keep the cards organized by relevance. Cards and decks can be added, modified, and/or deleted.
